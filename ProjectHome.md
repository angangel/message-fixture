Using this library, you can easily send and receive messages onto any JMS provider. It also supplies specialized fixtures for [WebSphere MQ](http://www-306.ibm.com/software/integration/wmq/).

The library is based on [ServiceFixture](http://servicefixture.sourceforge.net/) which means we can also use its support for testing web services and databases.
